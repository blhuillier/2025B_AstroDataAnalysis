## Course Overview

This course offers an in-depth introduction to **modern statistical and machine learning methods** applied to data analysis in physics and astronomy. Emphasis is placed on both theoretical foundations and practical implementation. Students will gain hands-on experience working with real or simulated astronomical data using Python-based tools.

Topics include estimation theory, hypothesis testing, goodness-of-fit, cross-validation, information criteria, Bayesian inference, and probabilistic programming.

---

## Course Format

Each class is structured into:

- 🧠 **Theory** – lectures on core concepts in statistics and data science  
- 💻 **Practice** – hands-on coding sessions using Python (Jupyter notebooks or other preferred tools)

---

## Course Components

- 🏠 **Homework Assignments**: Regular assignments with hands-on coding problems  
- 🗣️ **Homework Presentations**: One group presents each assignment in class  
- 📊 **Final Project**: Student-defined topic (with instructor approval) involving astronomical data analysis  
- 📄 Final Report (30%)  
- 🧑‍🏫 Final Presentation (15%)  
- 📝 Homework (30%)  
- 🎙️ Homework Presentation (15%)  
- 📅 Attendance and Participation (10%)

## Project Guidelines

Students are encouraged to define their own final project topics (observational or simulated data). The project should demonstrate both a sound methodological approach and clarity in scientific communication.

See the [Project Guidelines](Project_Guidelines_Fall2025.md) for more details.
