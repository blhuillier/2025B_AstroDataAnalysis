# Oral Presentation Guidelines and Grading (100 points)

Each group will give a **10-minute presentation per person**  
(e.g., 20 minutes for 2 students, 30 minutes for 3 students).  
The goal is to communicate your **scientific question, methods, results, and their significance** clearly and concisely.

---

# Presentation Guidelines

## 1. Motivation & Problem Statement
- Introduce the **astronomical context**.
- State the **scientific or statistical question** clearly.
- Explain **why the problem is interesting or important**.

---

## 2. Dataset and Pre-treatment
- Describe the dataset or simulation (source, size, key variables).
- Explain **data cleaning**, cuts, filters, and **why** they were applied.
- Include one or two clear plots of raw or pre-treated data.

---

## 3. Methods & Statistical Tools
- Summarize the main statistical methods used:
  - Estimation (MLE, Bayesian inference, regression, etc.)
  - Uncertainty quantification (bootstrap, jackknife, MC, MCMC)
  - Model choice or comparison (if applicable)
- Focus on **intuition**, not code.

---

## 4. Main Results
- Present the key results with **clear, well-labeled figures**.
- Highlight trends, fitted parameters, or physical quantities.
- Discuss surprises, challenges, or interpretation issues.

---

## 5. Uncertainty & Robustness Analysis
- Describe how uncertainties were estimated.
- Discuss **reliability** of the results (bias, variance, sensitivity to cuts).
- Interpret error bars, confidence intervals, or posterior widths.

---

## 6. Interpretation & Conclusion
- Explain **what your results mean scientifically**.
- Connect back to the original question.
- Mention limitations and potential improvements.
- Give a concise final conclusion.

---

## Presentation Expectations
- **Timing:** ~1 minute per slide; stay within allotted time.  
- **Teamwork:** all members present comparable portions.  
- **Figures:** clean, readable plots; no code screenshots.  
- **Communication:** clear, structured, and at the right level.  

---

## Guideline:  Slide Structure (Not mandatory, just as a reference)
1. Title & team members  
2. Scientific motivation  
3. Dataset & pre-treatment  
4. Methods  
5. Results (multiple slides)  
6. Uncertainty analysis  
7. Interpretation  
8. Conclusion

# Oral Presentation Grading (100 points)

| Criterion | Points | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **1. Scientific Motivation & Problem Statement** | **15** | Clear explanation of the astrophysical question; why it is interesting or important; context is correctly introduced. |
| **2. Dataset & Pre-treatment** | **15** | Dataset is well described; data cuts or filtering are justified; figures of raw/cleaned data are clear. |
| **3. Methods & Statistical Reasoning** | **20** | Methods are correctly summarized; intuition is clear; statistical choices are scientifically justified. |
| **4. Results & Figures** | **25** | Plots are clear, properly labelled, and meaningful; results are interpreted correctly; key insights are highlighted. |
| **5. Uncertainty & Robustness Analysis** | **10** | Clear description of uncertainty estimation; discussion of robustness and limitations. |
| **6. Delivery, Structure & Timing** | **10** | Presentation is well structured, on time, and clearly communicated. |
| **7. Conclusion & Scientific Insight** | **5** | Strong scientific conclusion; limitations acknowledged; possible improvements mentioned. |

## Total: **100 points**

### Notes
- Excessive detail on code, unreadable figures, or poor time management may lead to deductions.  
- Grading emphasizes **clarity, reasoning, and interpretation**, not just numerical output.  
- Each member must meaningfully contribute to the presentation.
